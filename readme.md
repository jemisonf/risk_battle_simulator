# Risk Simulator

This is a short program for simulating the results of risk battles.

## Building

Compile using `make`. Requires g++ and uses the c++17 standard.

## Using

This program is used to simulate the results of a series of risk battles where the attacker and defender always have the same number of dice. To set the number of battles and number of dice, edit `main.cpp` to change the `num_games` `num_attacker_dice` and `num_defender_dice` variables.
